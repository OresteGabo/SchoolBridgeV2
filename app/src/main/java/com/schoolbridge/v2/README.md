# 📚 SchoolBridge App

SchoolBridge is an **Android app built with Jetpack Compose** that connects schools, students, teachers, and parents in one platform.  
It provides a digital timetable, scheduling tools, and a messaging system to improve communication and time management in schools.

## 🎯 Why SchoolBridge?

In many high schools, most students are **boarding** — they live at school for an entire semester. This creates a gap in communication between parents and schools. Parents often only learn about problems (such as poor discipline, low marks, or sanctions) when it is already too late, sometimes even after a student is expelled.

SchoolBridge aims to **bridge this gap** by keeping parents continuously informed:

- **Academic Performance**: Parents can follow up on marks, progress, and conduct evaluations.
- **Discipline & Behavior**: Parents are notified about misconduct reports, conduct marks, and sanctions in real time.
- **Visit Tracking**: When a student is visited at school, parents are alerted. This is especially important in preventing risky or harmful visits (e.g., underage girls being visited by older men).
- **Permission Monitoring**: Parents can see when and why a student is granted permission to leave the school grounds.

By giving parents visibility into their children’s school life, SchoolBridge helps prevent surprises, strengthens trust between schools and families, and improves student safety and accountability.

## 🚀 Features

- **Timetable Management**
    - School administrators can set up official timetables.
    - Users (students/teachers) can add **self-schedules** to better manage their time.  
      *(Self-schedules only appear for the user who created them, even if shown in the timetable view).*
    - When a course is modified in the timetable, all concerned users (students + teachers) get notified.

- **Messaging System**
    - Built on **MQTT protocol** (`Eclipse Paho`).
    - Supports **message threads** instead of continuous chat.
    - Users get notified of role change requests, admin messages, and important announcements.

- **Role Management**
    - Users can request a role (e.g., student, teacher, admin).
    - School admins can approve/revoke requests.
    - Roles affect available functionality in the app.

- **Customization**
    - **Multi-language support**: English, French, Kinyarwanda (Swahili in progress).
    - **Themes & Material Design 3 expressive UI**: Light/dark mode, color palettes, etc.
